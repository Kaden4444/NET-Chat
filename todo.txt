make an acceptor thread for sending okay, change both their labels, close both clients
threads when clicking send (only activeate send button when connected to peer)

then every time we send, we grab the labels name, use the server to grab ip and port, and finally send the message



option 2:
create a single chat port, that way, it will just send and recieve on one port, without needing to know about labels or names or anything
